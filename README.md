# YouTube_API
This Project is developed in Django Python.

# Project Goal - 
To make an API to fetch latest videos sorted in reverse chronological order of their publishing date-time from YouTube for a given tag/search query in a paginated response.

# What this Project basically does is - 
```buildoutvfg
1. Uses YouTube API to fetch list of videos of certain search keyword
2. Stores it in dictionary
3. Displays that dictionary in web page in paginated response
```

# Result - 
After running this django project in your local system the final paginated response will look like this -

# Functionality Covered -
```buildoutcfg
- Server call the YouTube API continuously in background with some interval (here - 20 seconds)
- Fetch the latest videos for a predefined search query (here - "Football")
- Stores the data of videosin a database with proper indexes (here - Index starts with 1)
- A GET API which returns the stored video data in a paginated response sorted in descending order of published datetime.
- Scalable and optimised.
- Added support for supplying multiple API keys so that if quota is exhausted on one, it automatically uses the next available key.
```

# Key Files Used - 
```buildoutvfg
mysite/yt/views.py
mysite/yt/templates/yt/home.html
```
- "views.py" contains the code for the API usage and data extraction.
- "home.html" contains the code for the UI of the web page in which the final paginated response from API will be displayed.
